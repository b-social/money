# ClojureWerkz Money, a Clojure Library to Work With Money

ClojureWerkz Money is a Clojure library that deals with monetary values


## Documentation & Examples

ClojureWerkz Money is a very young project and until 1.0 is released and documentation guides are written,
it may be challenging to use for anyone except the author. For code examples, see our test
suite.

Once the library matures, we will update this document.

CI is hosted by [travis-ci.org](http://travis-ci.org)


## Development

Money uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make sure you have it installed and then run tests against Clojure 1.3.0 and 1.4.0[-beta5] using

    lein2 all test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all tests pass, submit
a pull request on Github.
